          Hi, it looks like you are using a mobile device (or at least a device
          with a screen that isn&apos;t very wide).
        </p>

        <p>
          This article features some interactive experiences which are optimized
          for PCs, so the experience on smartphones is a little rough around the
          edges. (They still work, just not very well)
        </p>
        <p>
          But don&apos;t worry! You can still read the text and try out the
          interactive parts later on a PC.
        </p>
      </div>
    </Modal>
  )
