# How to programmatically touch grass

</Prose>

<Toggleable title="Introduction" maxHeight={2500} opened={true}>
<Prose>
As a math and computer science enthusiast, I'm often told to touch grass. I never fully understood what that meant, but one thing I'm sure of is that I don't want to go outside. However, why not kill two birds with one stone and simulate some plants on my PC?
Today's journey is about understanding how to make it possible using math, computer science, and a pinch of basic intuition.

<Gif url="https://giphy.com/embed/kRfIKQ6ADUJaM" width={480} height={264} />

At first, it's natural to try taking inspiration from state-of-the-art virtual botanic sceneries like the ones in video games. The results are amazing but they take the combined effort of tons of talented artists and designers because they are usually based on skillfully human-crafted assets.

Check out this view. It's definitely beyond what I can create artistically or handle on my own. 
Nah… the computer has to do all the heavy lifting for me.
Furthermore, like many other things in life, I don't really care about the 3rd dimension or photorealism. A 2D drawing will be more than enough.
A procedural generation algorithm is what I'm looking for.

The task at hand is quite different from your usual textbook problem. While still focusing on a specific topic you can't expect a clear-cut solution. The path we'll be exploring is just one among infinitely many and it is meant to be a source of inspiration for you to dig your own unique way.

When facing such a broad problem, a good first step is to shoot the messenger with a ton of questions:

1. What do you mean by recreating plants?
2. Which kind of plants?
3. Should this be a faithful recreation or can we get away with some artistic liberties?

Well, as we said, we'll focus on drawings. The most important requirement is that the system must be flexible enough to draw any sort of plant: a tree, a fern, a blade of grass, a bush, and even algae.

<Gif url="https://giphy.com/embed/yFfPrA6TaURfa" width="480" height="269" />

The result should be pretty convincing, but there has to be room for artistic expression. We want to be able to create any plant, even those that come from an alien planet, and have smiley faces as leaves.

<Toggleable title="Time to Abstract" maxHeight={3000}>
<Prose>
Okay, now that the goal is set, we can properly start. This phase is arguably the most important one: don't panic!
The infinitely many roads are all facing us and taking the first step can be daunting. Simply staring at them won't get us anywhere though, so let's just pick one without the fear of retracing our steps.

Let's start by tackling our biggest requirement: flexibility.

A lot of different scenarios, one system to draw them all.
If you think about it, this is no novelty for any mathematician. Arguably, math is built for this.

<Gif url="https://giphy.com/embed/ne3xrYlWtQFtC" width="480" height="205" />

Let's take numbers for instance. They were first introduced to keep track of quantity. But the number of fingers on our hands, the liters of fuel needed for a trip to Mars, or the ratio between the circumference and the radius of a circle, are all widely different use cases.
Extracting common rules and concepts from different instances is called an abstraction.
As numbers are an essential abstraction for counting, similarly, we need a shared descriptor of plants for our drawings.

The process of abstraction usually starts by distinguishing what are case-specific details and what intrinsically defines the objects at hand.
In practice, we can take some pictures of real plants we'd like to draw and literally blur the details by... blurring the pictures. Then we can think about different elements individually and see their role in defining the blurred picture.

This is not that different from what a painter or an illustrator would do.

</Prose>

<TreesBlurSketch />

<Prose>
  The first things to go away are leaves, flowers, fruits, berries, and all that
  stuff. What's left is the branching structure, thus it's the most impacting
  element of the picture. We're also not interested in any kind of color or
  thickness for now, so we can get rid of those elements too by representing
  everything with straight lines. Nice! Let's focus on that then.
</Prose>

<TreesSketch />

<Prose>
Now that the image has been abstracted to its fundamental components we need to make it procedural and re-creatable by an algorithm.
</Prose>
</Toggleable>

<Toggleable title="A closer look" maxHeight={6000}>

<Prose>
It can be useful to start analyzing the problem from the start and gather some ideas.

Let's take some pictures of plants and observe them with the eyes of a scientist.

</Prose>

<MultipleScales />

<Prose>
Okay, despite the differences, the branching structures all look similar.
This time, though, it's not just details that are changing, but something more fundamental. Can you spot what it is?

They are all at different scales! To our abstraction goggles microalgae and secular redwoods are very much alike.

</Prose>

<Prose>
This weak influence of scale is no ordinary property because it comes with some heavy consequences.

If we take a tree, for example, and zoom in on one of its branches, the only thing that changes is scale. Since we noticed that it isn't a determining factor, we don't expect it to be much different for any other abstracted trees.  
And sure enough, there it is, a tree camouflaged as part of a bigger one.

<Zoom />

With some necessary formalities, this property takes the name of self-similarity.
Much can be said about its implications and impact on mathematics. Nonetheless, for the sake of time, I'll leave that to your own curiosity.

<Gif url="https://giphy.com/embed/aFTt8wvDtqKCQ" width="385" height="480" />

Let's get back to our problem. Our recent discovery allows us to describe a tree just as a bunch of smaller trees glued together! Amazing!

</Prose>

<Prose>
Knowing that, If we associate this base element to the symbol T we get a weird definition:   
T = ½ T + ½ T    
What? We reference the definition itself when defining it?   
What you see is a recursion. Both math and computer science are full of them.

<Gif url="https://giphy.com/embed/aaODAv1iuQdgI" width="471" height="480" />

You may be spotting a problem though, the definition by recursion implies the creation of a perfect self-similar tree, but that's not what's outside in the nearest park.
That's definitely a valid concern, but for now, let's try to tame the simpler case first. We can add back the complexity later.

</Prose>
</Toggleable>

<Toggleable title="In a perfect world">

<Prose>
Let's look at a perfect self-similar plant!

What would it look like? How would you draw it?

Well, firstly there are actually some almost self-similar plants in nature. Look at them!

</Prose>

<SelfSimilarPlants />

<Prose>
If we want to recreate them we may go back to the recursive definition and literally put a smaller copy of the whole drawing as a part of the drawing itself. Much like when you make two mirrors face each other, or a webcam pointed at his video output.

You can play around with this concept here. Try building something that resembles a fern or a Romanesco broccoli.

</Prose>

<DWD_editor />

<Prose>
I hope you were successful in your mission. But despite that, I guess we can both agree that this method has its flaws.   
First of all, we don't really have any control over the copies, they are no more than that, and we don't choose the depth of the recurrence.   
Furthermore, we don't have a clear description of the plant at hand.   
We need to improve this!

</Prose>

</Toggleable>

<Toggleable title="Turtle time" maxHeight={5000}>
<Prose>
Let's go back again to our abstracted plants. Can we abstract them even more? Is there a pattern between all of them?   
Despite all the case-specific intricacies, we reduced every drawing to just being made of straight segments.

Thanks to this simplification we can use what's arguably the simplest way of drawing programmatically: Turtle graphics.

<Gif url="https://giphy.com/embed/naXyAp2VYMR4k" width="300" height="300" />

Picture a turtle with a pen strapped to its back. It can just move forward, rotate around its center and get the pen on and off the paper. If you think about it for a moment, or even try to sketch something you'll realize that these 4 elementary moves are sufficient to draw any picture.

Let's give a name to those instructions:

- **F**: go forward with the pen down.
- **+**: rotate to the left.
- **-**: rotate to the right.
- **f**: go forward with the pen up.

To make things easier we can fix the amount of movement and rotation per symbol.  
For instance, we can say that all translations are of 10 px and all rotations happen in 10 deg steps.  
Even with this limitation, we can draw pretty much every abstracted plant we encountered so far. Let's try replicating a simple branch for instance.

</Prose>

<TurtleSketch
  allowedCommands={toCmdSeq('Ff+-')}
  defaultSeq={toCmdSeq('FF+F------f++++F')}
/>

<Prose>
As you can see the process is not particularly hard but a bit convoluted. Especially if you consider that going back to the beginning of an already drawn branch, to then draw the next, implies doubling the number of instructions.

To unclutter this back-and-forth we can keep track of the turtle's movement using a stack: a way of organizing data that, just like a stack of plates, lets you add and remove elements only from the top.

<Gif
  url="https://giphy.com/embed/XbOm89GxrH04brxiQw"
  width="480"
  height="480"
/>

To represent these two actions we'll introduce two new symbols: **[** and **]**.  
Upon reading one of them, the turtle will:

- **[**: store the current position and orientation;
- **]**: move up the pen, retrieve the last stored position and orientation, get there and allign itself.

Retrieving data from a stack "pops"(or in simpler terms "retrieves, uses, discards") it so we don't need to worry about duplication.

Let's try the simple branch again:

</Prose>

<TurtleSketch
  allowedCommands={toCmdSeq('Ff+-[]')}
  defaultSeq={toCmdSeq('F[+F][-F]')}
/>

<Prose>
Much cleaner now! Perfect! Now that we have the tool to draw with, we can tackle the self-similarity.
</Prose>
</Toggleable>

<Toggleable title="A binary comeback">
<Prose>
Let's start by recalling the recursive definition of tree stated earlier and formalizing it using the branch constructed in the previous chapter.   
**T = ½ T + ½ T** becomes **T = F[+T][-T]**.

The exact solution to this “equation” would require a shape that is infinitely self-similar. Not only would that be very difficult to define but we don't even really care about it since all plants are finite. Instead, we can lose the symmetry of the equality and read it as an assignment. Then '**=**' becomes '**->**'.  
**T -> F[+T][-T]**  
Now we can just start from a T and iteratively apply the assignment by substituting each T with the right side of the arrow. A literal find and replace.

For example: **T** becomes **F[+T][-T]** that becomes **F[+F[+T][-T]][-F[+T][-T]]** that then becomes **F[+F[+F[+T][-T]][-F[+T][-T]]][-F[+F[+T][-T]][-F[+T][-T]]]**.  
We can draw the result using our trusted turtle by simply ignoring the **T**s and here it is.

</Prose>
<TurtleSketch allowedCommands={toCmdSeq('Ff+-T[]')} defaultSeq={toCmdSeq("F[+F[+F][-F]][-F[+F][-F]]")} />

<Prose>
Amazing! That's basically a line binary tree!

Now that we have proof that our discovery works for at least a kind of tree, it is time to formalize our method and explore its capabilities.

</Prose>

<Toggleable title="Beyond the example, the dawn of the L-system">

<Prose>
It is safe to say that we can split the task between two different systems that work together: one for the generation of the strings and one for the drawings.

The latter is easy, we can use any basic turtle engine.  
For the former, we need to think back at what we did and try to formalize the process.

We started by defining a set of symbols: F, +, -, f.  
We can call this set of characters we expect to manage, an **alphabet**.

Then we defined a “relation” between our characters.  
We said that every T will turn in F[+T][-T].  
We called it an assignment, but **production** is a more suitable term, since the value of T isn't actually changed.

In our simple example, we needed just one production but there is nothing against having multiple ones. We just need to be careful and avoid overlaps. Each character should be associated with just one production. At least for now ;)

Then we chose a character to start from, the initial T.
Since it's kind of inexplicably there at the beginning we can call it an **axiom** and once again we shouldn't limit ourselves to just one character. It may also be a string.

Once defined T as the axiom, i.e. the start, the process becomes an iterative find and replace.

We iterate through each character of the string and look for a match among the productions. If one is found we substitute the right side of the production with the character we were considering, otherwise we just leave it there and proceed with the next one.  
Once we've processed each character we start all over again until the desired level of detail is reached.

</Prose>

<TextLSystem/ >

<Prose>

What we just described is a Lindenmayer System. It gets its name from the bright botanist who first came up with it, Aristid Lindenmayer.  
Commonly abbreviated to L-systems, they are an example of a broader class of computational objects called formal grammars.

<Gif url="https://giphy.com/embed/1405fIarqbN7hu" width="480" height="363" />

If you think about it, we are assigning to each branching structure a sequence of characters and we are trying to generate only “meaningful” ones since we want those representing a plant.  
It is not that different from the generation of a “meaningful” sentence in English, in the sense of conveying actual meaning.
While in English it's way more complex, for example would be concerned about the meaning of each word, here we only care about the structure, as if we only cared for the grammatical coherence of an English senctece.  
So what we actually need is only the grammar of this new weird language.

The magic of separating the string generation from the drawing is that while the first system captures the essence of the structure the second one leaves a lot of room for artistic expression!  
We can assign the characters whatever interpretation we may think of, ranging from drawing a flower, to producing a certain musical note, to changing the color of the line, or whatever you can come up with.  
We are not limited by 2 dimensions either! We can just add more symbols and interpret them as different movements in space for instance.
This is the perfect way to bring back those scenario-specific details we lost by blurring the pictures at the beginning!

Once again we could be here talking for hours about L-systems and their huge amount of variations, possibilities, applications, classifications, and whatnot and once again I'll leave that to your own curiosity and maybe a future article/video.

For now, you can try and experiment with a graphical version of what we discussed so far.  
Here you'll be no longer restrained by a fixed amount of rotation and length per character so you can let your imagination roam free.

_In this applet all the symbols are interpreted as lines. In the production editor you have a yellow reference to indicate the symbol that is being replaced._

Finally, let's just get back to an issue we left behind: the variation.

We now need to exit the world of perfection and go back to reality. We can use a trick that seems to come so easily to nature: randomness.

<Gif url="https://giphy.com/embed/a8TIlyVS7JixO" width="480" height="445" />

To achieve this we need to lose the determinism of our system, meaning that one set of alphabet, productions, and axioms will no longer always produce the same drawing. And the easiest way to do that is by allowing overlap in the productions.

You see if there are multiple productions from the same character the procedure has to make a choice. You may go for the first match for instance, but much more interestingly you can make it randomly. You can make the computer just roll a die.

In this way, we break the stiffness of self-similarity and allow an exponentially increasing amount of organic results. What we've built is called a stochastic L-system.

Our branching structure is officially tamed!  
And since we said that the details and artistic interpretations are easily introduceable in the drawing system we are finally all done!

Here you can experiment with stochastic L-systems as much as you want!

</Prose>

<TextLSystem stochastic={true} />

</Toggleable>

<Toggleable title="The Faraway Journey, Farewell Friends">
<Prose>

Our journey stops here at the moment.
We successfully managed to make a computer programmatically tame the intricacies of the organic shapes that surround us. The key takeaway here is not the destination though.
L-systems are just one among a myriad of different plant drawing algorithms, each with its own story, pros, and cons. What I'd like you to appreciate is how we got here. How we didn't stop facing a task so broad and complex and how by iteratively going through simplifications and hopefully intuitive choices we produced a solution quite elegant in its simplicity.

I also hope that you are left with few answers but many new questions in mind and I highly encourage you to take the loose threads of this article as an excuse to dive deeper into this topic. Trust me, there is an infinite amount of wonders hidden between the leaves of a computer-generated plant!
